### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Luis

Currently looking for my first job as a Jr. Full Stack Developer.

I am really excited for succesfully completing my bootcamp with 4Gekks Academy, and is the time to put all that knowledge into work, and of course, continue this learning process.

My main programming languages/platform are: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS / Bootstrap / Python / SQL
